abstract: This paper proposes a novel edge detection algorithm based on model
  fitting and the calculation of the first order derivative of two-dimensional
  images. It is central to mention that the aforementioned calculation can only
  be done through approximations since the image being used is made of a sequel
  of discrete samples, and the continuity is brought in through the model
  function which needs to offer the property of first order differentiability.
  The cubic bivariate polynomial was used in this paper. Indeed, the partial
  first order derivatives of the images are calculated after fitting the model
  function to the image data. It is found that the cubic bivariate polynomial
  shows visible edges of the images as seen in the results section. The
  usefulness of the methodology is also tested on a range of images, practical
  applications, and performance analysis under realistic conditions.
